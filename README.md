Hi, my name is Natalie!

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Rosalind.info bioinformatics problems. 

As I work through these problems, I both wanted to practice Python (with a bioinformatics focus) and archive my solutions.

I hope you find this informational and helpful!

*Also, please don't use these solutions without contacting me.*
